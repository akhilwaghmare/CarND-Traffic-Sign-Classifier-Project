Overview
---
In this project, we use  deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we then try out the model on images of German traffic signs from the web.
